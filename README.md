## Installation Instructions for Setting Up Your Project

To ensure a seamless installation process, follow these steps carefully:

1. **MongoDB Configuration**  
   Begin by incorporating your MongoDB database URI into the designated `.env` file. This essential step is pivotal for establishing a secure connection to your database. The format should resemble the following: `mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@server/<database_name>`. Replace the placeholders with your actual database credentials.

2. **Front-End API Configuration**  
   Proceed to fine-tune the project's front-end API services by editing the `src/config.js` file. This configuration empowers you to tailor the API settings to your precise needs, ensuring optimal functionality and integration.

3. **Server Start-Up**  
   Initiate the server by executing the command `npm run server` in your terminal. This action launches the server component of your project, enabling the efficient handling of data and requests.

4. **Vite Start-Up**  
   Activate Vite, the cutting-edge build tool, by utilizing the command `npm run dev`. This dynamic tool optimizes the development experience, facilitating rapid iteration and real-time updates.

By adhering to these meticulously outlined steps, you'll guarantee a professional and smooth installation process, setting the stage for a successful project launch.
